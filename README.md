# Inmo Air Glasses Real-Time Language Translator

## Overview

Welcome to the **Inmo Air Glasses Real-Time Language Translator** project. This project is developed for **Inmo Air VR Glasses**, providing an immersive experience by enabling real-time translation between multiple languages directly within the virtual environment. Designed for Android using Java, this app leverages the cutting-edge capabilities of VR technology to break down language barriers in real-time, allowing users to seamlessly communicate and understand various languages on the go.

## Features

- **Real-Time Translation**: Translates spoken or written words into multiple target languages in real-time, providing instant communication without delays.
  
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports a wide range of languages for both input and output, enabling translations between multiple languages at once.

- **Voice Recognition**: Utilizes advanced speech-to-text technology to recognize and transcribe spoken language for translation.

- **Text Input**: Users can input text manually for translation via a virtual keyboard or connected devices.

- **Immersive VR Interface**: Integrated with Inmo Air VR glasses to display translations in an immersive, interactive virtual environment. The translations are displayed in a way that doesn’t disrupt the VR experience, providing a seamless flow.

- **Customizable Display**: Users can customize how translations appear, such as text size, color, and positioning within the VR environment for optimal readability.

- **Multi-Mode Translation**:
  - **Conversation Mode**: For real-time conversations between two or more people speaking different languages.
  - **Text Mode**: Translate written text from physical or digital sources in real-time.
  
- **Offline Translation**: Supports offline translation for select languages, allowing users to continue using the translator without an internet connection.

- **Speech Output**: Provides text-to-speech capabilities to vocalize translations for users, making it easier to understand and use translations in a natural conversation.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI tailored to enhance the VR experience without overwhelming users with unnecessary complexity.

## Technologies Used

- **Android (Java)**: The core of the application is built using Java for Android, ensuring compatibility with Android devices and smooth integration with Inmo Air VR glasses.
  
- **Google ML Kit**: Used for text and speech recognition, providing powerful translation capabilities.
  
- **Google Translate API**: Integrated to handle translations between different languages in real-time.
  
- **VR Integration**: Customized for use with Inmo Air glasses, ensuring translations are displayed within the virtual environment without interrupting the user's experience.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Pair your Inmo Air glasses with your Android device via Bluetooth.
2. **Launch the App**: Open the app on your Android device, and it will automatically sync with the Inmo Air VR glasses.
3. **Select Languages**: Choose the source and target languages from the app’s menu.
4. **Start Translation**:
   - For **voice translation**, simply speak into the microphone, and the translation will appear in the VR display.
   - For **text translation**, input text using the virtual keyboard or scan text from physical/digital sources.
5. **Switch Modes**: Toggle between Conversation Mode or Text Mode based on your needs.
6. **Customization**: Adjust the display settings for translation text in the VR environment for the best viewing experience.
7. **Offline Use**: For offline translation, pre-download the required language packs in the settings.
